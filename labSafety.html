  The four laboratory objectives serve to guide our purpose throughout the semester. Notice that
  we begin from the development of a safety conscious mindset. In Appendix B we discuss the
  laboratory notebook. In Appendix C we discuss measurements and statistical data analysis.

Developing a Safety Consciousness Mindset 
</span>
<br><br>

<p class="the-chemistry-2">
  <span class="span">
Chemistry is a laboratory science. As such, laboratory work is a critical component of your
chemistry course. Developing an awareness for laboratory safety begins with acquiring knowl-
edge in the basic principles and procedures of laboratory safety. This knowledge serves as the
foundation from which students will deepen their safety mindset as they progress through
the chemistry program. That said, it is understood that for anyone to genuinely be safety
conscious and develop a safety ethic, one needs to learn the why behind safety. Internalizing
the why, individuals are more likely to identify safety issues and make decisions that reflect
their personal safety, values, and knowledge. The American Chemical Society developed the acronym RAMP to 
facilitate the development of a safety conscious laboratory environment. The acronym is further explained below:

Recognize Hazards
</span>
<br><br>

<p class="recognize-hazard-1">
  <span class="span">
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Hazard:</span> A laboratory hazard is any source that has the potential to incur damage or harm to
  an individual's health.
  </span>
  <br><br>


  <ol class="hazard">
    <li>Use labels on bottles and containers to identify the most important hazards of the con-
      tents. Use Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), which are standardized documents that contain
      information on the physical properties of each chemical. They also contain the physical
      and environmental health hazards, recommended protective measures, safety precautions
      for storing, handling, and transporting said chemical. The SDS also includes information
      on:</li><br>

      <ul>
     <li>Personal Protective Equipment</li><br>
     <li>First-Aid Procedures</li><br>
     <li>Chemical Spill Clean-Up Procedures</li><br>
      </ul>
    <li>Understand the nature of the hazard (i.e. its chemistry). When this is recognized one able
      to categorize the hazard as either flammable, corrosive, irritant, explosive, or oxidizer.</li><br>
    <li>Identify the important physical hazards from equipment, lab conditions and experimen-
      tal procedures. These can include electrical hazards, mechanical hazards, high or low
      temperature or pressure systems.</li>
  </ol>
  <br><br>


  <p class="assess">
    <span class="span">
    Assess Risk
    </span>
    <br><br>
  
  <p class="assess-risk">
  <span class="span">
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Risk:</span> Risk refers to the likelihood of harm to 
  an individual or damage a given hazard poses.
  </span>
  <br><br> 

  <ol class="assess-risk-1">
    <li>Asses the risk presented by the most important hazards. To assess the extent of risk by
      considering how one might be exposed to a given hazard and what would be the result of
      the exposure.</li><br>

      
    <li>Prior to using equipment. Ensure glassware is not cracked and in good shape and working
      condition. The same applies to equipment: gas hoses, the power cable for hot plates, the
      fume hoods etc.</li><br>
    <li>Identify the important physical hazards from equipment, lab conditions and experimen-
      tal procedures. These can include electrical hazards, mechanical hazards, high or low
      temperature or pressure systems.</li><br>

    Minimize The Hazard
    </span>
    <br><br>

    <ol class="minimize-1">
      <li>Identify safe practices and lab methods to minimize the risk from exposure to chemicals
        and physical hazards.</li><br>
  
        
      <li>Be familiar with measures of control including:</li><br>

        <UL>
         <LI>The proper use of personal protective equipment (gogles, gloves,lab aprons).</LI><br>
         <li>The proper use of fume hoods.</li><br>
         <li>Be familiar with experimental procedures, techniques to be employed as one performs
          an experiment</li><br>

        </UL>


      <li>Know the common methods used to minimize hazards (goggles, gloves, aprons etc.) and
        the limitations of those protective measures.</li><br>

      <li>Be aware that all work in the laboratory poses a risk, that mindful and deliberate planning
        and preparation are critical to minimize said risk.</li><br>

      <li>Know the location of waster containers for discarding chemicals. Know as well the proper use of the waste containers.</li><br>

      <li>Instructors will discuss experimental procedures aimed at minimizing risk both in a gen-
        eral way and with regard to each experiment.</li><br>
    </ol>

      Prepare for Emergencies
      </span>

      <ol class="prepare-1">
        <li>Be aware of the procedures for handling common emergencies such as chemical spills,
          small cuts or burns, exposures, and fires.</li><br>
    
          
        <li>BInstructors will discuss emergency procedures with students, both in a general way and
          with regard to each experiment.</li><br>
  
  
        <li>Ensure that all safety equipment, such as eyewash,  re extinguishers,  rst aid kit, and
          safety shower, are readily available and in proper working order.</li><br>
  
        <li>Be aware that all work in the laboratory poses a risk, that mindful and deliberate planning
          and preparation are critical to minimize said risk.</li><br>
  
        <li>Be aware of the importance of reporting laboratory incidents and the lessons that can be
          learned from the incidents that do occur.</li><br>
