 The Chemistry Challenge Exam is held four times a semester. The exam is only for students who are   
challenging the prerequisite to enroll in Chemistry 01A, &nbsp;&nbsp; which is successful completion of 
Chemistry 015.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is an outline of the procedure for reserving a spot to attemp the
Chemistry Challenge Exam:<br /><br />Prior to scheduling an appointment for the exam, students are
to obtain a Prerequisite Challenge Form.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prerequisite Challenge Form is to be
formally initiated by an academic counselor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should contact the 
Counseling Department at (408) 288-3750 to schedule a counseling appointment or to learn about counseling drop-in
dates/times.</span>

<span class="text-wrapper7"></span>
<span class="span">
After a student obtains a signed Prerequisite Challenge Form, students must contact the &amp; Science   
Division Office at (408) 288-3716 or visit room S-201 (in the Science Complex) to reserve 
a seat for the exam. <br /><br /> Students will be notified of the exam results, via email, by the end of day after  
completion of the Chemistry Challenge Exam. To be recommended to bypass Chemistry 015 and
enroll in Chemistry 01A students must provide a correct response to 17 out of 24 exam questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, earn a score of 70%
or higher on the exam. <br />  
</span>
</p>
<p class="students-are">
Students are encouraged to work with an academic counselor so as to develop
a plan to complete the Chemistry Challenge Exam during the regular Spring and  
Fall semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the Chemistry Department does not have
a process to offer the Prerequisite Challenge Exam during the campus closure period.<br /><br />For 
questions, please contact the Administrative Assistant for the Dean of Math and Science at: <br /><br />Phone Number: (408) 288-3716<br />
Email: Ricci.Lee@sjcc.edu<br />Monday-Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm<br /><br />

<div class="a-student-may">
A student may attempt the Chemistry Challenge Exam one time per semester.
The Chemistry Prerequisite Challenge Exam is a 60 minute exam, consisting of 24 multiple choice type questions.
As such, students will have 60 minutes to complete the exam.  To be recommended for enrollment in Chemistry 01A the student must
provide the correct answer, to a minimum, of 17 out of the 24 exam questions. This amounts to earning a minimum score of 70%
on the exam.<br /><br />Exam questions pertain to course content covered in Chemistry 015.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
The list below contains Chemistry 015 topics organized by chapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are encouraged to use the list of topics covered in Chemistry 015 as
well as the Chemistry 015 student learning outcomes as a guide to prepare for the exam. Students will be 
provided with the Periodic Table of the Elements on exam day.  See example below.

<ol class="apply-safety-rules">

<li> Apply safety rules learned in the lab to safely conduct lab operations and present laboratory data using
  graphing and precision of data wih simple statistics. </li><br>

 <li>Distinguish between elements and compounds, their physical and chemical properties, along with ionic and covalent 
  compounds, and the writting of their names and formulas.</li> <br>

 <li> Describe the internal structure of atoms 
  using subatomic particles, the meaning nuclear symbols for isotopes while predicting the nature of chemical bonds and  
  and molecular polarity from the periodicity of the element.</li> <br>

 <li> Explain the concepts of chemical stoichiometry at both the macroscopic and
  particulate level while applying these concepts to solving chemical reaction problems from rea-world information
  and predicting products of simple chemical reaction types.</li><br>
  
 <li>  Explain gas behavior using macroscopic properties
  and microscopic molecular dynsmics and solve problems of gases using the combined gas law 
  and ideal gas law. </li><br>
